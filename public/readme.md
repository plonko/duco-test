Hey Sebastian!

It was great chatting with you today!

As mentioned on the phone, I am sending you over our front-end take home project!

I've attached a readme with the problem description, it involves Star Wars :) I hope the instructions in the readme are sufficient but if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!

There is no set deadline for this but we suggest you complete it over the next week.

Best of luck!

### Star Wars Character Search

The Star Wars API [ https://swapi.co/ ] offers searchable information about Star Wars characters, and other objects.

Create a web application which lets users search for Star Wars characters, and displays known information about them.

- The application should get its information by querying the SWAPI JSON API.
- There shouldn't be any search button. As user types, the application should either list autocomplete suggestions or just display results based on partial match.
- The displayed information should include at least the character's name, traits, and films they appeared in.
- The application should have proper tests (either unit tests or browser tests are fine).
- There should be sensible styling for displayed information (feel free to use Bootstrap or similar framework if you wish).

You can use any frontend framework (React, Vue.js, jQuery etc.).

You can use plain Javascript or any language which compiles to it (JSX, Typescript, Coffeescript etc.).

You don't need to worry about old browsers. Latest Chrome only is fine.

The task should take about 3-4h.

Please upload the code to a Github or Bitbucket repository and include a README with instructions how to run it.

NOTE:

- We recommend that you make frequent commits to the repository to allow us to see your progress.

We'll discuss your solution during the in-person interview.

Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions about the task.

Happy coding!
